# database-project
Website to connect to and query a database of traffic incidents.
  
To run, simply ensure 'police_login.php', 'police_main.php' and 'police_results.php' are in the same directory. 

Please note: 
* The database is hosted on mysql Nottingham Servers. You will be unable to connect to the database unless running this on a machine at the University of Nottingham. If you wish, you can recreate the database using 'database for import.txt' on a server and alter the code to connect to this server. 
* The website makes no attempt to encrypt passwords or provide any type of security. It was simply an introduction to html and php.
